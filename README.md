This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own SQLite" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/sqlite).

In this challenge, you'll build a barebones SQLite implementation that supports
basic SQL statements like `SELECT`/`INSERT`. Along the way we'll learn about
[SQLite's file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html), how indexed data
is stored in B-trees and more.

# Passing the first stage

CodeCrafters runs tests when you do a `git push`. Make an empty commit and push
your solution to see the first stage fail.

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "Running tests"
git push origin master
```

You should see a failure message that says it expected "number of tables: <n>"
to be present.

Go to `app/main.py` and uncomment the `.dbinfo` command implementation. Commit
and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "pass the first stage"
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Running Your Program Locally

1. Ensure you have `python (3.8)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_sqlite3.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Sample Databases

To make testing queries locally, we've added three sample databases in the root
of this repository:

1. `sample.db`
   - This contains two tables: `apples` & `oranges`.
   - Use this to test the first 5 stages.
1. `superheroes.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database for stage 6
   - It contains one table: `superheroes`.
1. `companies.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database for stage 7
   - It contains one table: `companies`, and one index: `idx_companies_country`

You can explore these databases by running queries against them like this:

```sh
$ sqlite3 sample.db "select id, name from apples"
1|Granny Smith
2|Fuji
3|Honeycrisp
4|Golden Delicious
```
